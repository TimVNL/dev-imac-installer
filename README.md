# dev-imac-installer

This script was written sometime in 2017 or 2018 with the goal of installing new iMacs in an identical way for all programmers in an organization.

## Warning!
This script hasn't been updated for a long time and probably won't work on Mac OS versions after 2018, the code is for reference only at the moment.

There will be no more updates!
